TODO:
1. pressing button at end of logic sequence triggers confetti. 
2. Add address verification api in AddressForm.
3. Add tests.
4. Issue form?
5. Notifications for when the treats are available.
6. Add applepay and google pay as options. maybe paypal.
7. Need to fix the address form to display properly. It seems like the imports aren't working properly for the client secret and the prop 'stripe'
8. There's a weird unintended effect where if you're currently scrolling when you press a button, it doesn't scroll you to the next view.
