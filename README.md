# Delightful Little Treat

Have you ever wished you could just press a button and get a delightful little treat? Now you can!

    ヽ(・∀・)ﾉ

<br>

This website has extremely minimal UI and only two options (treat or no treat) to help you not have to think that hard. All you have to do is click a button or two and fill out an address/payment form, then the treat will get delivered.

    (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘳𝘢𝘺!!
<br>
Unfortunately, we can only deliver to a small area within the New Orleans area right now. Maybe we can deliver to more places in the future?
